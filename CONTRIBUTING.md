## Issues

1. Always search before submitting an issue to avoid duplicates and redundancy. If a similar issue exists, post a comment inside of it, instead of creating a new issue.
2. When submitting a bug, feature request, or question, be sure to use the appropriate labels, i.e., `bug`, `enhancement`, or `question`.
3. Include any relevant files, such as ePubs. Github allows for image uploading directly in the comment editor. For other files, try a service such as [Data File Host](http://datafilehost.com).
