## Issues

1. Always search before submitting an issue to avoid duplicates and redundancy. If a similar issue exists, post a comment inside of it, instead of creating a new issue. (commenting +1 is a common way to express support for an issue.)
2. Include any relevant files, such as ePubs. Github allows for image uploading directly in the comment editor. For other files, try a service such as [Send Space](http://sendspace.com), or [Data File Host](http://datafilehost.com).
